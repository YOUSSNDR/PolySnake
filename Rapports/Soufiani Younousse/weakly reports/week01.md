I have started to schematizes some simple situation to visualize how the program will work.
Situation 1(left turn):

study of the servomotor and the Arduino library needed to use it.
I start by moving one servomotors then two of them.
There is the program used:
[program test1](https://github.com/YOUSSNDR/PolySnake/blob/main/programmes/servomoteurs/test1/test1.ino)

They are troubles with the servomotors:
- some unwanted movement
- trouble to reach the ask angle
- issues to synchronize the servomotors together
Those issues may come from the fact that those servomotors unlike the usual I use goes to 270 degrees. 
I will have to gather more data about them.
