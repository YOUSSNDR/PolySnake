searching a new motor for the whells, In order to get more torque we might use a continuous rotaion servo motor,i have found a tutorial for how to make a continuous rotation servo motor out of a basic servo motor
[How_to_make_a_360_degree_Continuous_Rotation_Servo_Motor](https://youtu.be/mRO0wfSQ6jw)

We learn here that they are two major step:
- first for the mechanical part,we must flatten the last gear in order to remove the mechanical block and dril it to disconect it from the potentiometer
- then for the electronic part we must disconect the pin of the potentiometer linked to the board and on the board link the signal pin with the positive pin and the negative pin with a resistor(same resistor for each pin)

but we should see first if they are not already made contnuous rotation servo motor.

Learning how to use OpenCV python for object recognition. For that i use this video [Computer Vision With Arduino | 2 Hour Course | OpenCV Python](https://youtu.be/mfiRJ1qgToc).
Which help to learn a lot of arduino basics but also some basics with OpenCV
