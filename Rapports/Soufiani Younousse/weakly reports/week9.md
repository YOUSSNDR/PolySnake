Research of a new motor for the whells, In order to get more torque we might use a continuous rotation servo motor, i have found a tutorial for how to make a continuous rotation servo motor out of a basic servo motor which could be a solution for our motor
[How_to_make_a_360_degree_Continuous_Rotation_Servo_Motor](https://youtu.be/mRO0wfSQ6jw)

We learn here that they are two major step:
- first for the mechanical part, we must flatten the last gear in order to remove the mechanical block and dril it to disconect it from the potentiometer
- then for the electronic part we must disconect the pin of the potentiometer linked to the board and on the board link the signal pin with the positive and negative pin with a resistor(same resistor for each pin)

but we should see first if they are not already made contnuous rotation servo motor.

Change of plans we will be using a material to make the modules behind the head slide on the floor while the head will guide them.
We will have to make some test to found the best motor.

Learning how to use OpenCV python for object recognition. For that i use this video [Computer Vision With Arduino | 2 Hour Course | OpenCV Python](https://youtu.be/mfiRJ1qgToc).
Which help to learn a lot of arduino basics but also some basics with OpenCV
thanks to an arduino library given in the video i will be able to make comunicate python and arduino which will allow me to modificate the mouvement witeout having to download again in the arduino uno.
I will modificate the code for this purpos and continue the video to learn about the image recognition part.
